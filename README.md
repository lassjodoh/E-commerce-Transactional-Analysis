# E-commerce Transactional Data Analysis
### Overview
This project focuses on analysing transactional data from an online retail business. The dataset contains information about various transactions that have occurred on the e-commerce website. The aim is to gain insights into customer behaviour and identify factors that contribute to the revenue of the website. Additionally, the project explores the development of a predictive model to forecast revenue sessions and assess its performance.
### Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis consists of transactional data from an online retail business. The dataset provides a comprehensive view of the transactions occurring on the website, enabling us to perform a detailed analysis.
Problem Statement
##### The project aims to address the following key questions:
1.	Factors Contributing to Revenue: Identify the different factors that can identify customers contributing to the revenue of the website. By analysing customer behaviour, demographics, and purchase patterns, we can determine the key drivers of revenue.
2.	Predictive Model for Revenue Sessions: Explore the development of a predictive model that can forecast revenue sessions. By utilizing machine learning techniques, such as regression or classification algorithms, we can build a model that predicts the likelihood of a session resulting in revenue.
3.	Performance Assessment: Evaluate the performance of the predictive model. This includes assessing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to determine the model's effectiveness in predicting revenue sessions. 
### Methodology
The project will follow the following methodology:
1.	Data Pre-processing: Clean and pre-process the transactional data. This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming the data into a suitable format for analysis.
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis: Perform exploratory analysis to gain insights into customer behaviour. Analyse factors such as exit rate, bounce rate, and product preferences to understand their impact on revenue.
3.	Feature Engineering: Extract meaningful features from the dataset that can be used to build the predictive model. This involved creating new variables and transforming existing features.
4.	Model Development: Develop a predictive model to forecast revenue sessions. This involved selecting appropriate machine learning algorithms, splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
5.	Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the predictive model using relevant evaluation metrics. Compare the model's predictions with the actual revenue sessions to determine its accuracy and effectiveness.
### Technologies Used
The analysis and model development will be conducted using the following technologies:
+	Python: Programming language for data pre-processing, analysis, and model development.
+	Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library in Python.
+	Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for model development and evaluation.
+	Matplotlib and Seaborn: Visualization libraries for creating insightful plots and charts.
+	Jupyter Notebook: Integrated development environment for code development and documentation.
### Conclusion
By analysing the transactional data from the online retail business, we aim to uncover the factors contributing to revenue and develop a predictive model for revenue sessions. The insights gained from this analysis can help in understanding customer behaviour, enhancing conversion funnels, and improving overall business performance.
